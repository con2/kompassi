class AlternativeProgrammeForm(models.Model):
    """
    Most programmes are registered using the default form. However, some programmes are "special",
    such as the role playing games. We would still like to get their programmes, but they need to
    answer a different set of stupid questions.

    This model represents an alternative form that some the hosts of these "special" progammes can
    use to sign up. If you have dabbled with Labour, think of the AlternativeSignupForm.

    Where this differs from AlternativeSignupForm is that we may also choose to publish some of
    these.

    Instances of AlternativeProgrammeForm are supposed to be installed in the database by a setup
    script. For examples, see `hitpoint2017/management/commands/setup_hitpoint2017.py` and look for
    AlternativeProgrammeForm.

    The actual form classes should inherit from django.forms.ModelForm and
    programme.forms.AlternativeFormMixin. For examples, see
    `hitpoint2017/forms.py` and look for RolePlayingGameForm and FreeformProgrammeForm.

    Note that if AlternativeProgrammeForms are specified at all for an event, then if you want to
    allow the default form, also it must be provided as an AlternativeProgrammeForm. If no
    AlternativeProgrammeForms are specified, the default form is used.
