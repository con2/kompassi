title: Survey on Tracon Hitpoint's larp programme
description: |
  Tracon Hitpoint is planning to expand its larp programme with the vision
  of "The most interesting larp event in Tampere in 2025". The purpose of
  this survey is to find out what kind of demand there is for a larp event
  and what kind of programme is expected from it. All questions are optional.
  At the end of the survey, there is an opportunity to leave
  your contact information if you want Tracon Hitpoint to contact you about
  organising the larp programme for the event.
