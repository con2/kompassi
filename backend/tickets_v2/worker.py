"""
usage: python manage.py tickets_v2_worker

A worker that sends receipts.
The worker is notified via `notify tickets_v2_paymentstamp` in Postgres.
In the absence of such notifications, the worker will poll the database every NOTIFY_TIMEOUT_SECONDS.
When roused, the worker will process all pending receipts and then go back to sleep.
