        Postgres, when left to its own devices, is prone to do seq scans on
        our ticket tables. This is because it thinks that the id column is
        not selective enough. We know better, and we can fix this by
        increasing the statistics target for the id column.

        Normally this would be overridden by autovacuum, but partitioned
        tables are not autovacuumed with ANALYZE. So the statistics target
        we set here will stick.

        The statistics target represents how many distinct values
        there are in the column. We know that the id column is unique, so
        we can set the statistics target to the maximum value of 10000.
